Horse Racing Betting Smart Contract
This is a smart contract written in Solidity programming language that enables users to place bets on horses in a virtual horse race.

Contract Variables
owner: stores the address of the contract owner who has the authority to change the minimum bet amount and distribute prizes.
minimumBet: stores the minimum bet amount set by the contract owner.
raceTime: stores the starting time of the virtual horse race in UNIX timestamp format.
raceLength: stores the duration of the virtual horse race in seconds.
bets: a mapping that associates the address of the better with their bet details such as the selected horse number and the bet amount.
currentTime: stores the current time in UNIX timestamp format.
Contract Functions
constructor(uint _minimumBet, uint _raceTime, uint _raceLength): initializes the contract variables with the provided values during contract deployment.
placeBet(uint horse) public payable: allows users to place a bet on a horse by sending the bet amount as Ether along with the selected horse number as a parameter.
changeMinimumBet(uint newMinimumBet) public: allows the contract owner to change the minimum bet amount.
cancelBet() public: allows users to cancel their bet before the race starts and receive a refund of their bet amount.
getMyBet() public view returns (uint, uint): allows users to view their placed bet amount and the selected horse number.
getWinningHorse() public view returns (uint): returns the winning horse number by using the current time to generate a random number between 1 and 10.
distributePrizes() public: allows the contract owner to distribute prizes to the winners and take a commission of 10% from the total bet amount on the winning horse.
getWinners(uint horse) public view returns (address[] memory): returns an array of addresses who placed bets on the provided horse number.
Usage
To use the smart contract, the user needs to deploy it on a blockchain network such as Ethereum using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, users can interact with the contract functions by calling them from their Ethereum wallet software such as MetaMask.

The process involves the following steps:

Deploy the contract on a blockchain network using Remix or Truffle.
Set the minimum bet amount, race time, and race length during contract deployment.
Users can place their bets on horses by sending the bet amount as Ether along with the selected horse number to the placeBet() function.
Users can cancel their bet and receive a refund before the race starts by calling the cancelBet() function.
After the race is over, the contract owner can distribute the prizes to the winners by calling the distributePrizes() function.
Security Considerations
As with any smart contract, it is crucial to ensure that it is secure and free from vulnerabilities that could result in the loss of funds. Here are some security considerations to keep in mind:

Ensure that the contract code has been audited by a professional auditor.
Use the latest version of the Solidity compiler and follow best practices for secure contract development.
Implement appropriate access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can call sensitive functions.
Implement appropriate error handling and input validation mechanisms to prevent unexpected behavior.
Consider using a multi-signature wallet for the contract owner to prevent the loss of funds in case of a compromised account.
